<p>The audit targets a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities.</p>
<p>Professionally evaluating the website&rsquo;s accessibility level is a key step in web accessibility and can be performed at any stage of a web or mobile app project.</p>
