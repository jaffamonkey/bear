Primary benefits of Quality Engineering Quality assurance and testing across the SDLC. Helping teams standardize the application of quality requirement. Adopt tooling to increase the efficiency of the process. Automating tests to eliminate issues related to manual testing. Integrating testing into CI/CD pipelines. Test development in line with development cycle. Every test should be able to provide the same answer of &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, at any point, to the question &ldquo;Are you useful?" />

<li>Every test should be able to provide the same answer of &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, at any point, to the question &ldquo;Are you useful?&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Starting lean with test framework is logical, wait for test developmemnt to highlight possible requirement.</li>
<li>Native tools always preferred, firstly for synergy with development and secondly performance and scope larger.</li>
<li>Test frameworks should be part of app codebase.</li>
