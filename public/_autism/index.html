  <p>Autism is a spectrum. Not everyone who is autistic prefers the same things. Many autistic people also have associated other conditions, like Dyslexia or Learning Difficulties thatimpact on their preferences. Many do not have other conditions. Other demographic factors can also impact people’s references, such as socio economic factors, and familiarity with technology.</p>
<p>These differences can make it challenging to design for all autistic web users, and below is a general guide to assist in those challenges.</p>
<h2 id="page-design">Page Design</h2>
<h3 id="background-images">Background images</h3>
<ul>
<li>Background images have to have a purpose. Geometric shapes in muted colours
work well but image collages are considered distracting.</li>
<li>For autistic web users they can struggle to distinguish between foreground and background.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="symmetry-in-design">Symmetry in design</h3>
<ul>
<li>There was a general preference for symmetry in design and for clearly defined sections
including images having clear boarders.</li>
<li>Symmetrically designed webpages were considered</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="logical-ordering">Logical ordering</h3>
<ul>
<li>All users expected some logical ordering of information on webpages – for example,importance (where the most important information is on top), alphabetical (lists), or chronological (in forums).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="logical-sizing-of-elements">Logical sizing of elements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Generally, participants associated the size of design elements (e.g. boxes)
with the importance of information/content presented in those areas.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="no-auto-playing-contentmovement">No auto-playing content/movement</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moving adverts in banners and pop-ups, auto-playing videos make websites inaccessible to most autistic web users.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="no-surprises">No surprises</h3>
<ul>
<li>Avoid unpredictable situations and changes. This includes changing designs of websites that they used.</li>
<li>Preview should be available with information on what pages, sections and videos are about before reading/watching them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="page-layout">Page Layout</h2>
<h3 id="design-clear-clutter-free-pages">Design clear, clutter-free pages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Build simple pages that include only elements relevant to the current user task</li>
<li>Cluttered, busy layouts make finding information difficult and do not
allow users to focus on their core tasks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="set-page-lengths-appropriately-to-the-page-type--function">Set page lengths appropriately to the page type &amp; function</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make decisions about the length of the page appropriately to its purpose. For
example, make your homepage short and ensure that important information &amp; sections are
available with minimum scrolling. Content pages, e.g. article pages may be longer to
facilitate uninterrupted reading.</li>
<li>Homepages that are too long do not allow users to focus on their core tasks and make
finding information difficult.</li>
<li>Too much scrolling makes autistic users feel ‘dizzy’ and ‘overwhelmed’.</li>
<li>On long pages, users can feel like they are lost in “something” that has no end.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="clearly-separate-design-elements--sections-that-do-not-belongtogether">Clearly separate design elements &amp; sections that do not belongtogether</h3>
<ul>
<li>Clearly separate different sections and items on the page by using white space
(i.e. space without text or graphics), outlines, boarders and dividers (i.e. lines) to help users</li>
<li>All design elements should have clearly defined outlines and boarders to be
able to focus on them, as well as to move between the different sections within the page. Lack of clear outlines can make vision blur.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="place-important-information-on-top-of-the-page-and-above-the-fold">Place important information on top of the page and above the fold</h3>
<ul>
<li>Whenever possible, establish a high-to-low hierarchy of importance of items on
the page.</li>
<li>Place the information that is most important for users on top of the page above
the fold.</li>
<li>For items of equal importance, use alphabetical listing, or chronological ordering
(e.g. forum threads, event timelines).</li>
<li>Users look for the most important information on top of the page above the fold.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="use-the-size-of-design-elements-to-communicate-the-importance-of-information-that-they-carry">Use the size of design elements to communicate the importance of information that they carry</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use the size of design elements (e.g. larger boxes) to help users find
important information easily.</li>
<li>Users judge the importance of information by the size of the boxes that carry
the information, i.e. the content in larger boxes is more important than information in
smaller boxes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="avoid-large-images-above-the-fold">Avoid large images above the fold</h3>
<ul>
<li>Avoid large images that would cover the entire space above the fold,
if there is more information below the fold.</li>
<li>Users were overwhelmed by large banners that covered most of the space above the
fold blocking their way to information below it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="for-each-page-provide-a-summary-of-the-page--its-purpose">For each page, provide a summary of the page &amp; its purpose</h3>
<p>Provide a short descriptive summary of the page to help users to understand
the topic and purpose of this page. This includes the homepage.
Users want to know what pages and sections of the website they are on and often the page titles are not descriptive enough to provide this information. Autistic users feel disorientated when this information is not available and are likely to leave the site.</p>
<h3 id="ensure-the-consistency-of-page-layout-using-symmetry">Ensure the consistency of page layout using symmetry</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that design elements are aligned and laid out symmetrically on the page.
Whenever possible, maintain an equal number of columns on the page.</li>
<li>Autistic users have a strong preference for symmetrically designed pages. Pages where visual elements (e.g. boxes or images) should ne aligned, and there are an equal number of columns in sections across the page.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="maintain-a-visual-consistency-of-design-elements-within-a-single-section-of-the-page">Maintain a visual consistency of design elements within a single section of the page</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that the shape of design elements within a single section of the page are
visually consistent.</li>
<li>Consistent visual design of elements grouped together in a container element, e.g. only boxes with rounded corners, or only boxes with square corners, but not both in the same section of the page.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="navigation">Navigation</h2>
<h3 id="design-consistent--simple-navigation-across-the-site">Design consistent &amp; simple navigation across the site</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that the navigation across the site is consistent and allows users to
understand how they can navigate to different pages &amp; sections on the site.</li>
<li>Websites with complex and inconsistent navigation make people use Google and
deep-link directly to the content. It also leads people away from the website as there may be other websites with similar content listed higher on the search pages. In the survey, confusing navigation was one of the main problems experienced online by autistic respondents.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ensure-that-all-links-and-buttons-are-visibly-clickable">Ensure that all links and buttons are visibly clickable</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that links are clearly visible and distinct from other text and non-clickable
elements, by using colour and underlining. Apply the design consistently across the site.</li>
<li>Autistic users expect links (including visited links) to be both underlined and differ in
colour from other text &amp; non-clickable elements.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ensure-that-users-understand-how-to-navigate-carousels">Ensure that users understand how to navigate carousels</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that users understand which element on the page is a carousel and how
they can access the multiple carousel panels. Make the navigation arrows clearly visible and
provide information about the number of panels in the carousel</li>
<li>Some of the less web-savvy users miss the arrows on the carousel, until prompted
to look for them. Some people do not want to interact with the carousel until they had information about the number of available panels.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="use-sequential-menus-with-fewer-items-to-select">Use sequential menus with fewer items to select</h3>
<ul>
<li>Design menus with fewer options that enable users to easily make selection</li>
<li>On-hover menus, as well as menus that include too many items discourage autistic
people from using the site. Sequential menus with fewer options that allow “pointing and clicking” rather than “mousing-over” work better for autistic users.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="use-a-sticky-main-menu">Use a sticky main menu</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use a sticky main menu on the top of the page, to enable users to easily navigate
to any other section of the website. Avoid other sticky design elements on the site, e.g. adverts</li>
<li>Autistic users said that they liked to always have access to other sections of the site
and a sticky main menu facilitated this. They found other sticky design elements on the page
distracting, e.g. sticky advert banners, sticky side nav with links to related content, or icons for content sharing.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="colours">Colours</h2>
<h3 id="avoid-using-lots-of-bright-colours-on-the-website">Avoid using lots of bright colours on the website</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use simple, soft colours and colour combinations for the background, logo,
images and text across the website. Autistic users prefer low-contrast colour schemes.</li>
<li>Bright contrasting colours are commonly known to be visually overstimulating. 64% of
survey respondents agreed that they got distracted by bright colours. 69% of respondents find
bright images distracting. (See also Guideline 3.2.)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="allow-users-to-customise-the-background--text-colours">Allow users to customise the background &amp; text colours</h3>
<ul>
<li>Allow users to choose the background and text colours that suit their needs.</li>
<li>There is no standard autistic colour preference.</li>
<li>Being able to choose their colours on the web would significantly improve user experience.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fonts">Fonts</h2>
<h3 id="choose-a-typeface-for-your-website-and-use-it-consistently">Choose a typeface for your website and use it consistently</h3>
<h3 id="use-at-least-12pt-font-across-the-website">Use at least 12pt font across the website</h3>
<ul>
<li>To ensure readability of text on the site, use a font size not smaller than 12 pt.</li>
<li>Generally, users prefer larger size fonts, at least 12 pt.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Avoid using serif &amp; sans-serif fonts on the same page</li>
<li>Avoid using too many typefaces on the site. Use consistently either a serif
or a sans-serif font across your website. Avoid using both a serif font &amp; a sans-serif font
on the same page.</li>
<li>Some autistic users prefer sans-serif fonts, while others read better in serif fonts.
Autistic users feel distracted when both type of fonts are used on the same page.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="allow-users-to-customise-the-font-type--size-to-suit-their-needs">Allow users to customise the font type &amp; size to suit their needs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Allow users to choose the font type &amp; size that best suit their needs, in order to
make reading easier for them</li>
<li>Autistic users have different preferences regarding the use of serif and sans-serif fonts,
and font sizes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="text">Text</h2>
<h3 id="ensure-sufficient-spacing-between-paragraphs-and-between-linesof-text">Ensure sufficient spacing between paragraphs and between linesof text</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use white space (areas not filled with text or graphics) consistently to separate paragraphs and lines of text</li>
<li>All users but particularly users with associated learning disabilities (those with “eye-
tracking” issues). People with ADHD find densely spaced text difficult to read</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="organise-text-into-short-paragraphs-and-use-short-lines">Organise text into short paragraphs and use short lines</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use short paragraphs and short lines to organise the text for easier reading</li>
<li>Users found long paragraphs and long lines difficult to read.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="do-not-interrupt-the-flow-of-text-with-images-or-other-designelements">Do not interrupt the flow of text with images or other designelements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Avoid splitting the text with elements that may interrupt the flow of reading. Avoid
scroll-stoppers that may mislead users into thinking that they have reached the end of the text
when they have not.</li>
<li>Users want to be able to read the text without interruption. Large images or video
content placed in the text interrupt users’ thought process. It is worse when the design element fills up a large part of the screen.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="avoid-using-bold-text-style-for-large-amounts-of-text-and-in-combination-with-other-text-styles">Avoid using bold text style for large amounts of text and in combination with other text styles</h3>
<ul>
<li>Limit the use of bold text to highlight keywords or important phrases in the text to make them stand out to readers</li>

agitated.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bold-the-keywords-to-facilitate-rapid-scanning-of-text-for-important-information">Bold the keywords to facilitate rapid scanning of text for important information</h3>
<ul>

<h3 id="consider-providing-information-in-video-format">Consider providing information in video format</h3>
<ul>
<li>Consider providing information in video format with captions &amp; transcripts</li>
<li>THis will make it easier for users to process and remember information
from video than from text only. Most users also find captions and transcripts for videos useful.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="use-visuals-with-the-text-to-facilitate-understanding">Use visuals with the text to facilitate understanding</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use visuals to facilitate understanding of textual information and to help users
locate required information on the page.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="use-icons-to-help-users-locate-information-faster">Use icons to help users locate information faster</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use meaningful &amp; memorable icons to help users find information on the page</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="images">Images</h2>
<h3 id="use-simple-images-that-can-be-easily-understood">Use simple images that can be easily understood</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use simple images that can be understood at “a glance”, without a need for a deep visual analysis.</li>

<ul>
<li>Make sure your images are meaningful and add value &amp; clarity to the text
information on the page</li>
<li>Autistic users wanted images to be meaningful and congruent with the story on the
page. Images must add value, provide more information or clarification to the text, represent
information visually (e.g. infographics).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="limit-the-use-of-background-images-and-decorative-graphics">Limit the use of background images and decorative graphics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use background images sparingly, especially if they are overlaid with text. If you use
decorative graphics, ensure they do not distract the users from reading text.
Use non-patterned backgrounds on content pages to facilitate uninterrupted reading.</li>
<li>Autistic users find background images and decorative graphics distracting, They
preferred plain background, especially on content pages where there is much textual information to read through.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="use-photographs-of-people-only-if-depicted-people-are-relevant-to-the-information">Use photographs of people only if depicted people are relevant to the information</h3>

<h2 id="video-and-audio">Video and audio</h2>
<h3 id="disable-auto-play">Disable auto-play</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do not make video content to auto-play on pages, even if the sound is off. Users
prefer control over what content is playing and when it is playing.</li>
<li>If you include auto-play there was must be an option to turn it off.</li>
<li>Auto-playing videos made users feel “nervous” and “out of control” over their online
experience. They wanted to be able to decide what and when they want to watch or listen to.</li>
